# Sentiment Analysis

## Problem Statement
In this project, tweet about six airlines are analyzed to predict a tweet contains positive, negative or neutral sentiment about the airline. This is a typical supervised learning task where given a text strring, we have to categorize the text sring into predefined categories.

## Project Outline
* Data Analysis
* Data Cleaning
* TF-IDF
* Making Predictions and Evaluating the Model

## Data Analysis
Data is analyzed with proper pie chart and bar chart. At last, sentiment confidence is plotted with respect to positive, negative and neutral comments.

## Data Cleaning
Tweets contain many slang words and punctuation marks. Those are cleaned before used for training the machine learning model.

## TF-IDF
Term frequency and inverse document frequency is used by TfidfVectorizer in Scikit-Learn to convert string to TF-IDF featured vector. The idea behind is the words that occur less in all the documents and more in individual document contribute more toward classification.

## Making Predictions and Evaluating the Model
Prediction is done with RandomForsetClassifier class which is also used for training. From that classification_report, confusion_matrix and accuracy_score are computed. This model has accuracy score of 64%.
